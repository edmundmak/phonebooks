# phonebooks
The app was developed with .net core for the backend using c#
- code first approach was used with entity framework
- to generate database, migration and database-update is needed
- there is already seeding for the username and password including the phone book name
- The frontend was done with angular using reactive forms
- The front end has three pages:
 -1 Login
- select your desired phonebook which is passed within the session
- for login username:login, password:123456
- routing redirects to login page
 - 2 Home
 - 3 Add new phone book
